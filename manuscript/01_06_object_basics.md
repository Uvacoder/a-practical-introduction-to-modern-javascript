## The Object type

This section will introduce the Object type. We will only learn the basics here.

An object is data structure with String or Symbol keys and arbitrary values. Imagine it like a machine that accepts a key, and gives you a value. Some people call this data structure *associative array*, others call it *hashmap*. These names may sound fancy, but essentially we mean the same damn thing.

*Side note: we will only deal with `String` keys for now. `Symbol` keys are also allowed for strings. This is an advanced topic, you will learn it later.*

An associative array is like human memory. In order to get access to a memory, we need an association, which is a handle or a key. This key unlocks the memory by providing access to it. The address of associative memory is therefore content. In JavaScript, we will use strings to describe this content.

```
let author = {
  name: null,
  website: "zsoltnagy.eu",
  age: 35
}

console.table( author );
```

Run the above code in the console of Google Chrome developer tools. You can see that `console.table` enumerates the keys and values of the `author` object in a tabular format.

Similarly, `console.log( author )` also logs the `author` object, but in this log, we need more clicks to read the keys and values.

The members of the `author` object can be accessed using a dot. For instance, `author.name` gives you read and write access to the `name` property of the `author` object. For instance, we can read the `author.name` value and log it using `console.log( author.name )`. To change the value of the name property, we have to wrtie `author.name = 'Zsolt'`.

```
author.name = "Zsolt";
console.log( author.name, author.website )
// Prints: Zsolt zsoltnagy.eu
```

It is possible to delete members of an object using the `delete` operator:

```
delete author.name
console.log( "Author name: ", author.name )
// Prints: Author name: undefined
```

If a field in an object is deleted or not even declared, the value of this field is `undefined`.

```
let o = {};

> o.name
undefined
```

An object contains *fields*. A *field* in an object can be referenced in the following ways:

- the already introduced dot notation: `object_name.member_name`
- bracket (associative array) notation: `object_name[ string_or_symbol_value ]`

Let's explore how we can select a member of an object if the corresponding key is in a variable:

```
let key = 'website';

// How can we select author.website?
```

The solution is to use the bracket notation and get `author[ key ]`. The value inside the brackets is converted to a key.

```
author[ key ]
// Prints: zsoltnagy.eu
```

We already know that the key of an object is a string. If we supply a key of different type inside the brackets, then this key is automatically converted to a string:

```
const key = 1;
const street = {};

street[ key ] = 'house';

console.log( street );
```

After executing the above code, the value `{ "1": "house" }` is printed to the console.

A member of an object can be another object:

```
let car = { numberPlate: 'ABC123' };

let garage = {
    size: 1,
    parking: car
}
```

Here we can see that the garage has an integer size and an object propery called `parking`.

We typically build objects using braces by enumerating key-value pairs inside an opening brace and a closing brace. Once an object is built, we can add more properties to it:

```
garage.owner = { name: 'Zsolt' };
```

In the above example, we changed the value of `garage.owner` from the default `undefined` to an object.

We saw that we can refer to members of an object in two ways:

1. dot notation: the value of `garage[size]` is `1`,
2. bracket notation: `garage['size']` is `1`.

The two notations are equivalent.

It is important to note that in the bracket notation, you need a value that can be converted to a string and does not throw an error. Therefore, if you try to retrieve `garage[ nonExistingKey ]`, you get an error.

We will learn a lot more about objects later.


### Exercises: objects

**Exercise 27:** Create an object that models a lottery poll. A lottery poll is defined by its time. We model this time using a string of format `"2020-11-25 18:20"`. We also store the prize, which is also a string of form `"20.000.000$"`. We also store five numbers that can range between `1` and `90`. These values are stored in an array.

**Exercise 28:** Suppose the following object is given:

```
let ticket = {
    from: {
        airport: 'HAN',
        date: '2020-11-05',
        time: '09:40'
    },
    to: {
        airport: 'AAA',
        date: '2020-11-05',
        time: '11:25'
    },
    name: 'Java Script',
    passport: '123456XY'
}
```

Using this object, write the following values to the console:

- start and arrival time and date,
- name,
- passport id,
- airport code of the destination.

**Exercise 29:** Create an object that contains an infinitely long chain of object references. For instance, if you call your object `tree`, make sure `tree.tree`, `tree.tree.tree`, `tree.tree.tree.tree` etc. are all available.

```
let tree = { leaf: "fruit" };

// Write your solution here such that the below logs
// all write "fruit"

console.log( tree.leaf );            // "fruit"
console.log( tree.tree.leaf );       // "fruit"
console.log( tree.tree.tree.leaf );  // "fruit"
// ...
```

**Exercise 30:** Suppose there is a `safe` object. The safe is opened by a secret key combination `"123456"`. Create a reference that unlocks the safe and provide access to the value belonging to the key `"123456"`.

```
let safe = { "123456": "$10.000" };
```

**Exercise 31:** We learned that the key of an object can either be a string or a symbol. Suppose that there is a variable declared and defined as `let num = 5;`. Consider the following code:

```
let num = 5;
let o = {};

o[ num ] = true;

console.log( o, o[ 5 ], o[ "5" ] );
```

Run the above code in your console and check the output. Explain what happens to the `5` key in `o[ 5 ]` that results in the log you saw.

Now let's create a variable containing the `"5"` string, and run this code:

```
let text = '5';

o[ 'text' ] = false;

console.log( o, o[ 5 ], o[ "5" ] );
```

Run the above code and explain what happens when querying `o[ 5 ]`.

**Exercise 32:** Create a `map` object with keys of the values of array `arr`. The values belonging to the keys are universally `true`. Use the `console.table` function to inspect the `map` object in Chrome developer tools.

```
let arr = [1, 5, 3, 1];

let map = {};

// Write valid JavaScript code in place
// of the  ____ symbols to add key-value pairs to map.
// ____arr[0]____ = true;
// ____arr[1]____ = true;
// ____arr[2]____ = true;
// ____arr[3]____ = true;

console.table( map );
```

**Exercise 33:** Modify the previous exercise such that instead of `true`, the values belonging to keys `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, `arr[2]`, `arr[3]` are their respective indices `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`. Before running your code, determine the key-value pairs stored in the object `map`.

```
let arr = [1, 5, 3, 1];

let map = {};

// Write valid JavaScript code in place
// of the  ____ symbols to add key-value pairs to map.
// ____arr[0]____ = 0;
// ____arr[1]____ = 1;
// ____arr[2]____ = 2;
// ____arr[3]____ = 3;

console.table( map );
```
